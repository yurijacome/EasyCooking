# Google Login User Creation Implementation

## Steps to Complete

1. **Create createUserFromGoogle function in UserServices.jsx** ✅ COMPLETED
   - The backend already has a `/google-login` endpoint that handles user creation
   - No need to create a new function, can use existing endpoint

2. **Update NextAuth configuration in route.ts** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Added signIn callback to call the backend's /google-login endpoint when Google login succeeds
   - Pass user profile data to the backend

3. **Update UserContext.tsx** ✅ COMPLETED
   - Integrated with NextAuth sessions for better user state management
   - Added logic to fetch user data from backend using email
   - Updated backend to support filtering users by email

4. **Test the Google login flow** ⚠️ PENDING
   - Google OAuth credentials need to be configured in .env.local
   - Set up GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
   - Ensure NEXTAUTH_SECRET is configured
   - Set up redirect URI in Google Console to match your domain
   - Once configured, test the login flow to verify users are created in the database
